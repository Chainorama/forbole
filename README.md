# Forbole - An incentivised social ecosystem based on blockchain

When we need help, we will ask our trusted friends. If our friends cannot help, they will ask their trusted friends. This is where word-of-mouth referrals happen. By making referrals, we are not just helping the people we trust to seize opportunities, but also the people who need help to get the right solutions. The keyword of referrals is trust.

No matter it is about business or career, we rely heavily on our personal network. That is why we say "It's not what you know but who you know". For success, one's knowledge and skills are less useful and less important than one's network of personal contacts.

We are actively developing this incentivised social ecosystem. You can recommend and referral your trusted network over this platform and you will get rewards when you engage more.
